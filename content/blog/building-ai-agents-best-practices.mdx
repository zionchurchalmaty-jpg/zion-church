Creating an AI agent that effectively represents your expertise requires more than just uploading documents. Here are our top recommendations for building agents that clients will love.

## 1. Define Your Niche Clearly

The most successful agents are those with a well-defined scope. Instead of trying to be an expert in everything, focus on what you do best.

**Good examples:**
- "Tax planning for small business owners"
- "React performance optimization"
- "Personal injury law consultation"

**Less effective:**
- "General business advice"
- "All programming questions"
- "Legal help"

## 2. Train with Quality Content

Your agent is only as good as the knowledge it's trained on. Focus on:

### Primary Sources
- Your own written content (blogs, articles, books)
- Case studies from your work
- Frequently asked questions you've answered

### Secondary Sources
- Industry standards and guidelines
- Relevant academic research
- Professional certifications materials

## 3. Set Clear Boundaries

Let your agent know what it should and shouldn't do:

```markdown
Your agent should:
- Answer questions within your expertise
- Ask clarifying questions when needed
- Recommend human consultation for complex issues

Your agent should NOT:
- Provide advice outside your domain
- Make definitive diagnoses or legal rulings
- Share client confidential information
```

## 4. Test Extensively

Before going live, test your agent with:

1. **Common questions** - The basics that most clients ask
2. **Edge cases** - Unusual scenarios that test limits
3. **Out-of-scope questions** - Ensure it handles them gracefully

## 5. Iterate Based on Feedback

Monitor how clients interact with your agent and continuously improve:

- Review conversation logs
- Track satisfaction ratings
- Update training data regularly
