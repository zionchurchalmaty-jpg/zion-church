# ProAgent Me Landing Page Recommendations

> Proposed updates to https://www.proagentme.com/ to support the dual-vertical strategy (Developers + Legal/Accounting)

---

## Executive Summary

The current landing page positions ProAgent Me well for creators (experts), but the dual-vertical strategy requires updates to:

1. **Add client-focused messaging** emphasizing the "trust gap" for professional services
2. **Showcase multiple verticals** (Developers, Tax/Accounting, Legal)
3. **Highlight human escalation** as a key differentiator for professional services
4. **Add vertical-specific signup paths** to track demand by industry

---

## Current State Analysis

**What's working:**

- Clean design
- Clear creator value proposition
- Privacy promise
- Waitlist capture

**What needs updating:**

- Limited client-facing messaging (mostly creator-focused)
- Single vertical implied (developers/tech)
- Human escalation not prominently featured
- No vertical-specific paths for tracking demand
- "Trust gap" opportunity not addressed

---

## Proposed Page Structure

### Section 1: Hero (Updated)

**Current approach:** Single message, creator-focused

**Proposed approach:** Dual-track hero with tabs or side-by-side

#### Option A: Tabbed Hero

```

When "For Clients" tab is selected:

```
-----------------------------------------
|                                        |
|  "Expert-trained AI. Fraction of       |

|                                        |

#### Option B: Split Hero (Side-by-Side)

|  FOR EXPERTS       |  FOR CLIENTS      |

### Section 2: The Problem (New - Dual Track)

**For Creators:**

> "The Time-for-Money Trap"
>
> You're brilliant at what you do. But your income is capped by your calendar.
>
> $300/hour × 40 billable hours = ceiling.
>
> What if your expertise could work while you sleep?

**For Clients:**

> "The Trust Gap"
>
> You asked ChatGPT for tax advice. It sounded right.
> But would you bet $10,000 on it being correct?
>
> Generic AI gives generic answers. You need expert knowledge with accountability.

**Visual:** Split screen or alternating blocks

## Summary

The updated landing page will:

1. **Speak to both audiences** - Creators AND clients, not just creators
2. **Showcase multiple verticals** - Developers, Tax/Accounting, Legal
3. **Highlight human escalation** - The key differentiator for professional services
4. **Track demand by vertical** - Inform prioritization decisions
5. **Validate willingness to pay** - "Early access" checkbox as fake door test

These changes position ProAgent Me to capture the legal/accounting opportunity while maintaining the developer focus—and provide data to guide the go-to-market strategy.
